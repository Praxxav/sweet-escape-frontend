## My AI Usage

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was built with significant assistance from AI tools that acted as a pair programmer and productivity booster throughout the development process.

### Tools Used
- **Gemini Code Assist** ‚Äì for generating boilerplate, scaffolding components, and improving TypeScript usage.
- **ChatGPT** ‚Äì for troubleshooting errors, configuring tools (like ESLint, Jest, and Vercel/Render deploy scripts), and suggesting best practices.
- **GitHub Copilot** ‚Äì (if enabled in editor) for inline code completions and quick utility snippets.

### How I Used Them
- **Boilerplate & Components:** I used Gemini to scaffold React components (`tsx`) with proper TypeScript typings, state hooks, and props setup.  
- **Forms:** Gemini generated login and signup forms (`LoginForm.tsx`, `SignUpForm.tsx`) with field state management, validation via Zod, and submit handlers.  
- **Dashboards:** I leveraged Gemini to scaffold dashboards (`Dashboard.tsx`, `AdminDashboard.tsx`) including layouts, grid structures, and modal form implementations.  
- **Error Troubleshooting:** I used ChatGPT to debug configuration issues (e.g., Jest ES module errors, missing `test` script, Vercel/Render deployment fixes, CloudFront + S3 permissions).  
- **DevOps & Config:** ChatGPT helped write `netlify.toml`, deployment scripts, ESLint configs, and guided me through Git/GitHub workflows.  
- **Unit Testing:** I asked AI tools to generate starter test examples and explain test report setups (Jest/Vitest).  

### Reflection on AI‚Äôs Impact
Using AI tools significantly accelerated my development process:
- I spent less time on repetitive boilerplate and more time on business logic.  
- Debugging was faster since I could get step-by-step explanations and solutions without searching multiple forums.  
- I gained confidence in TypeScript and deployment workflows by learning from AI-generated examples.  
- However, I still needed to carefully review AI-generated code to ensure correctness, security, and maintainability.  

In summary, AI acted as a **collaborative coding assistant**, improving code quality, reducing development time, and helping me learn new tools more efficiently.


### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Praxxav/sweet-escape-frontend.git
    cd sweet-escape-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Backend URL:**
    Make sure the `BACKEND_URL` in `src/config.ts` points to your running backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

This project was built to demonstrate a full-stack application with clear separation of concerns between user and admin roles, dynamic data fetching, and a modern, responsive user interface.
