## My AI Usage
## AI-Assisted Development with Gemini Code Assist
In summary, Gemini Code Assist acted as a pair programmer throughout the development of this frontend, accelerating the process, improving code quality, and helping to implement features efficiently and correctly.
 **Boilerplate Code:** Gemini was instrumental in quickly generating the boilerplate for React components using TypeScript and `tsx`. This included functional components with props, state management hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and basic JSX structure.
-   **Forms:** Components like `LoginForm.tsx` and `SignUpForm.tsx` were scaffolded, including state management for form fields, submission handlers, and integration with Zod for validation.
-   **Dashboards:** The structure for both the user `Dashboard.tsx` and `AdminDashboard.tsx` was generated, including layouts for displaying data in grids and tables, and the implementation of the modal form for adding/editing sweets.


### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm or yarn

    cd sweet-escape-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Backend URL:**
    Make sure the `BACKEND_URL` in `src/config.ts` points to your running backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

4.  **Run the development server:**

    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

This project was built to demonstrate a full-stack application with clear separation of concerns between user and admin roles, dynamic data fetching, and a modern, responsive user interface.
